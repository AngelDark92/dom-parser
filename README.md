# XML to HTML Converter
 XML to HTML converter through XSLT instruction files.

## Usage
The program has a simple interface created in JavaFX. It can convert a single file or batch convert a folder. The XSLT files can be in sub or super folders as long as they are referenced in each XML file unser href property.

## Acknowledgements
The code can be refactored and made better, a progress bar will also need to be added, but the application works perfectly. If there are any issues please open them here on GitHub.
